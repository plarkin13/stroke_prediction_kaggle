> These is purely a guideline to help frame preliminary steps with new data analysis projects.  Not every project will follow these guidelines, however, as part of the discovery phase of any new project, it's important to scope properly.  These preliminary assumptions can help guide tasks such as model and features selection, deciding on key metrics, and establishing the overall workflow for your analysis.

In the field of data science, good projects are **practical**. Your capstone project should be manageable and affect a real world audience. This might be a domain you are familiar with, a particular interest you have, something that affects a community you are involved in, or an area that relates to a field you wish to work in.

One of the best ways to test ideas quickly is to share them with others. A good data scientist has to be comfortable discussing ideas and presenting to audiences. That's why for Part 1 of your Capstone project, you'll be preparing a lightning talk in addition to your initial notebook outlining the scope of your project.  

Once you have your data, review it to confirm whether your ideas are going to be as productive as you intended. If not, switch datasets, gather additional data (e.g. multiple datasets), or revise your project goals. This is not always a trivial task. Remember that data acquisition, transformation, and cleaning are typically the most time-consuming parts of data science projects, so donâ€™t procrastinate!

Create your own database and data dictionary, then clean and munge your data as appropriate. Finally, document your work so far.

**Suggested Goal**: Host a lightning talk presentation describing *at least two* project proposals, including associated data, goals, audiences, and metrics.

## Suggested Requirements
1. Prepare a slide deck for a small 10 minute lightning talk for a smaller group with your advisor (please practice this and make sure to keep this concise and brief to this time constraint!) on **at least two** potential topics for your DSI capstone project. 

> Have at least two topics with a complete set of goals, statement, metrics, and data.  The 3rd+ project idea can be more conceptual as long as you have a potential data source to point to.

2. Topic 1 and topic 2
   - Problem Statement
   - Potential Audience 
   - Goals
   - Success Metrics
   - Data Source(s)
   - Basic EDA
   
4. Beyond the two required topics, what other potential topics might you explore? (e.g. 3 or more)
5. For all datasets, identify their source, format, and necessary action items to obtain or access them.

## Suggested EDA Requirements
1. Create a "progress report" that documents:
   - Your approach to exploratory data analysis
   - Your initial results
   - Any roadblocks, setbacks, or surprises
   
2. Perform initial descriptive and visual analysis of your data.
   - Identify outliers
   - Summarize risks and limitations 

3. Discuss your proposed next steps
   - Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions
   - What are three concrete actions you need to take next?

## Suggested Data Requirements

It's very likely this will not be 100% complete but to the best of your ability, please be ready with at least some data that has accompanying, basic EDA ready to go.  Most projects will require iterative updates for data.

1. Find and Clean Your Data: Source and format the required data for your project. 
   - Create a database
   - Create a data dictionary
2. Perform preliminary data munging and cleaning of your data: organize your data relevant to your project goals. 
   - Review data to verify initial assumptions
   - Clean and munge data as necessary
3. Describe your data: keep your intended audience(s) in mind.
   - Document your work so far in a Jupyter notebook.

#### BONUS

4. Document your project goals in more detail (revise from your initial pitch after feedback)
   - Articulate why you chose your project and outline any future work
   - Outline proposed methods and models
   - Define potential impact of your project

5. Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) that describes your project idea, data, and audience. Link to it in your presentation appendix.

 ***Remember, if you can't find data to support your topic, then you can't move forward.***

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

**Begin by Asking:**
- What is the scope of the need or problem I wish to investigate?
- Who is this for? Who is impacted or affected by this data? Who would benefit from this model?
- What are my goals for this investigation?
- What does success look like? How will I know if my model performs well?
- Where will I find data for this project? Is the data available?

**For the Bonus, Ask:**
- What format is the data in? What specific steps do I need to take to access it?
- How will I explain this project to outside audiences?

**Other tips for getting started:**

- For your 1st potential topic, start with an idea, then look for potential data that could be used to support that idea.
- For your 2nd potential topic, reverse the process; look for interesting data and then extrapolate problems it could solve and audiences it could impact.
- Document **everything** as you go! This will give you valuable material to pull into your report - and will paint a more accurate picture than trying to summarize afterward :)
- Be candid! This is not a race, but a chance to get valuable feedback. Be honest about what techniques have worked, what steps have taken you down the wrong turns, and what blockers you've run into.
